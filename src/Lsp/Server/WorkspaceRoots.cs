/// convention of this codebase, keeping the guard testable (tests call
/// <see cref="Set"/>/<see cref="Clear"/>) without threading a dependency
/// through every handler constructor.
///
/// Edge cases (deliberate decisions):
/// - No roots declared yet: the guard is FAIL-OPEN. Clients that only send
///   the legacy rootUri, or nothing at all, keep working exactly as before
///   (including startup diagnostics and test fixtures outside any root);
///   enforcement begins the moment a workspace folder arrives.
/// - The workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders notification is not handled by
///   this server, so the set captured at initialize is final for the session.
/// - Paths are normalized with Path.GetFullPath and stored deduplicated.
